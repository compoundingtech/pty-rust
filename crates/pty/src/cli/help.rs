//! Help text for the `pty` binary.
//!
//! Every text here is vendored verbatim from the Node `pty` at `500eab2`. The
//! fixtures under `crates/pty/tests/fixtures/help/` are the bytes that binary
//! printed (`pty help`, `pty <cmd> --help`, ...), captured by running it under a
//! scratch `PTY_ROOT`, trailing newline included. Nothing is generated or
//! reformatted here; a text changes only when its fixture is re-captured.
//!
//! The three deferred commands (`recover`, `evidence`, `test`) keep the Node
//! help so the binary stays a drop-in; the commands themselves report that
//! they are not available in this build (see README.md and docs/parity.md §12).
//!
//! node: src/cli.ts:109-451 (`COMMAND_HELP`), src/cli.ts:470-478
