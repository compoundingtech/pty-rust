//! The per-session daemon: owns the PTY and a libghostty terminal actor,
//! serves the wire protocol over `<root>/<name>.sock`, publishes the
//! session's files, and records its exit — Node's `server.ts` with the
//! same ordering guarantees.
//!
//! - `pty-lifecycle` owns daemon launch and the shared start-up config.
//! - [`daemon_main`] implements the private `__daemon` entrypoint.
//! - [`env`], [`lifecycle`]: the child's environment, actor loop, publication,
//!   exit, and shutdown.
//! - [`clients`], [`geometry`], [`status`], [`events`]: the packet handlers,
//!   effective geometry, STATUS, and the events log.
//! - [`tree`]: descendant termination on an external kill.
