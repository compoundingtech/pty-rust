//! Typed two-plane PTY substrate primitives.
//!
//! [`SessionRef`] is shareable identity only. A [`SessionOwner`] is the sole
//! reader of a generation's PTY master and the sole reaper of its child. Each
//! [`SessionClient`] is an equal attachment: it can submit the same typed data
//! and lifecycle operations, but it never receives the master or child handle.
//! The actor serializes every operation and fences attachments by generation.
//!
//! Nothing the actor does can block on the child or on a client:
//!
//! - **Output is never dropped for being late.** Bytes the child wrote before
//!   it exited are forwarded until the PTY closes, however the reader and the
//!   reaper race, and the exit is published after them (see
//!   [`EXIT_OUTPUT_DRAIN`] for the one bound on that wait).
//! - **Every attachment queue is bounded.** A stream from
//!   [`SessionOwner::attach`] that falls [`DEFAULT_ATTACHMENT_CAPACITY`] bytes
//!   behind is detached with [`SessionError::Overflowed`]. The owner's
//!   pre-registered stream from [`external_owned_pair_attached`] is never
//!   detached; when it is full the owner stops reading the PTY until it drains,
//!   so the child waits the way it would on a real terminal and no output is
//!   lost.
//! - **Input is written by its own thread, without blocking.** A child that
//!   never reads stdin stalls only the input queued behind it, never
//!   termination, resizing, output or lifecycle queries, and the input is
//!   failed rather than left hanging once the child exits.
//! - **Signals are fenced against reaping.** The reaper waits for the child
//!   without collecting it, then collects it under the same lock every signal
//!   takes, so a signal can reach the child or its unreaped corpse and never a
//!   process that reused its pid.
