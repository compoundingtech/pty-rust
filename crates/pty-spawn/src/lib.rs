//! Allocate a pseudo-terminal and start a child process in it.
//!
//! **This crate is deliberately small, and deliberately free of the terminal
//! emulator.** It depends on `portable-pty` and nothing else, so it builds with
//! plain `cargo` on any platform the toolchain supports.
//!
//! That matters more than it looks. The rest of this workspace builds
//! `libghostty` from source with Zig, pinned at 0.15.2, and that Zig cannot
//! link the current macOS SDK — so a consumer that only wants a pty must not be
//! made to pay for a terminal emulator it will never ask a question of. Adding
//! any dependency here that pulls Zig in makes this crate unusable for its one
//! purpose. See `docs/parity.md` and the README build requirements.
//!
//! Three places in this workspace opened a pty independently before this crate
//! existed, with three different behaviours when it failed: a descriptive
//! error, a bare `io::Error`, and a panic. They now share one.

/// `exec` matters: without it the shell stays alive as the child's parent and
/// every signal, exit code and process-group operation addresses the wrapper
/// instead of the program. Passing the arguments after `sh` rather than
/// interpolating them into the script matters too, because it keeps argument
/// boundaries literal — an argument containing a space or a shell
/// metacharacter reaches the program unchanged.
