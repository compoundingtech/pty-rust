//! Port of tests/gc-keep-expiry.test.ts: `keep=true` buys a DEAD session a
//! bounded retention window against `pty gc`, not immortality. Agents tag a
//! session they are debugging right now and never come back to untag it, so
//! an unbounded exemption turns the registry into an append-only log.
//!
//! The policy pinned here: exempt while the session has been dead for less
//! than `--keep-max-age` (default 7d), swept and reported separately once
//! past it, `0` sweeps the whole backlog, and a RUNNING keep session is never
//! a candidate no matter what the flag says.
//!
//! Records are written straight into the root rather than spawned: the policy
//! is a comparison against `exitedAt`/`createdAt`, so a fabricated record is
//! both exact about age and free of daemon-startup waits.
