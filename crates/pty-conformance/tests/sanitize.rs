//! Port of tests/sanitize.test.ts. Node unit-tests its `TERMINAL_SANITIZE`
//! constant against an in-process xterm; a binary under test exposes the
//! same bytes through `pty attach` (written to the terminal when the
//! session exits or the client detaches) and through a non-plain `pty peek`
//! (appended after the screen). Each Node case becomes a check that the
//! reset sequence it relies on is present in what the CLI actually emits,
//! plus one test pinning the whole string and the trailers around it.
//!
//! The behavioural half of each Node case (feeding the bytes into an
//! emulator and checking the mode really flipped) is not re-expressed: the
//! sequences are standard and the byte check is what a drop-in binary must
//! reproduce.
