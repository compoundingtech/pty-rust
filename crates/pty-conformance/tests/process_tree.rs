//! Port of tests/process-tree.test.ts. Node unit-tests `process-tree.ts`
//! with injected process lists and signal hooks (snapshot order, start-token
//! identity, exact TERM-then-KILL); none of that is reachable through the
//! binary. What is observable is the contract those helpers serve: after
//! `pty kill`, every descendant of the session's child is dead — including a
//! leaf that ignores SIGHUP and SIGTERM, which only the exact SIGKILL step
//! can end. That one case is pinned here; the rest is library-only.
