//! The scrollback promise: a terminal asked for N lines of history retains N
//! lines, and says so.
//!
//! libghostty's `max_scrollback` is a byte budget for the history page list,
//! not a line count — its own doc comment says "lines" — and the page list
//! evicts whole pages. Passing 10 000 for "10 000 lines" buys one page: 745
//! rows at 80 columns, 456 at 200, 3 310 at 20. Every case here is about the
//! conversion that makes the declared line count true, and about the reported
//! numbers being the truth rather than the request.
