//! Encoding semantic input for the child: keys, mouse, focus, paste.
//!
//! This is the other half of the terminal boundary. A consumer that owns a
//! surface (a TUI pane, a GUI widget) knows *what the user did*; only the
//! terminal knows what bytes the child expects for it, because that depends on
//! state the child itself set: DECCKM, the keypad mode, `modifyOtherKeys`, the
//! kitty keyboard flags, the mouse tracking mode and report format, focus
//! reporting, bracketed paste. Splitting that knowledge — semantic events on
//! one side, a second encoder on the other — means two implementations of the
//! kitty keyboard protocol and a class of parity bug nobody can test.
//!
//! So the events here are deliberately dumb and owned ([`KeyEvent`],
//! [`MouseEvent`]), and the encoding happens inside the terminal:
//! [`crate::actor::TerminalActor::encode_key`] and friends, or
//! [`crate::handle::TerminalHandle::send_key`] to encode and write in one
//! ordered step.
//!
//! The encoders themselves are libghostty's ([`libghostty_vt::key`],
//! [`libghostty_vt::mouse`], [`libghostty_vt::focus`],
//! [`libghostty_vt::paste`]), configured from the live terminal. The key and
//! modifier vocabulary is re-exported rather than re-declared: a second
//! `Key` enum would be a translation table that silently drifts.
//!
//! What this module does *not* do: decide anything. It never swallows a key
//! for its own use and it has no notion of a shortcut, a leader, or a detach
//! sequence. A consumer that reserves keys evaluates them before it calls
//! here.
