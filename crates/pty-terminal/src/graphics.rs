//! Kitty graphics state: the durable, typed image state behind
//! [`crate::actor::TerminalActor`] and [`crate::handle::TerminalHandle`].
//!
//! libghostty owns the image storage; this module is the boundary that turns
//! its borrowed handles into owned, `Send` values a compositor can hold across
//! frames, and that puts the storage back on the wire for the ATTACH/PEEK
//! replay (see [`replay`]).
//!
//! What a consumer gets:
//!
//! - [`GraphicsState`]: the storage generation, every [`ImageDesc`] that has a
//!   placement, and every [`Placement`] with its resolved source crop, cell
//!   extent, and position in the window it was read for.
//! - [`ImageBytes`]: the pixels themselves, copied once, on request. Metadata
//!   is cheap enough to read per frame; bytes are not, so they are keyed by
//!   [`ImageDesc::generation`] and fetched only when that changes.
//!
//! Positions are typed rather than optional numbers ([`PlacementPosition`]):
//! libghostty resolves a cursor-positioned placement to a viewport cell, but a
//! virtual (Unicode placeholder) placement has no position of its own — it is
//! wherever its placeholder cells are. Those cells are ordinary text, each
//! naming its own image row and column, so this module decodes them from the
//! grid; that is what survives scrolling, reflow, and a windowed read.
//!
//! Kitty only: SIXEL and the iTerm2 protocol have no equivalent
//! arbitrary-pane contract and are not read here.
