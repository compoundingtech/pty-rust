//! # pty-core
//!
//! The terminal-free half of the Rust [pty](https://github.com/compoundingtech/pty)
//! port: the wire protocol, the on-disk session registry, the client
//! operations (peek / send / status / attach), and the pure-logic modules
//! ported from the Node project ([`keys`], [`paste`], [`duration`], [`input`],
//! [`queries`], [`ptyfile`]).
//!
//! This crate deliberately does not depend on libghostty, so it builds without
//! a Zig toolchain. Terminal emulation lives in `pty-terminal`; the daemon and
//! CLI live in the `pty` binary crate.
//!
//! # Lock compatibility boundary
//!
//! Rust publishes complete owner records atomically and makes stale stealing
//! exclusive between Rust contenders. Node retains an empty-publication window
//! and an unbound stale read-then-unlink. Rust respects a live, complete Node
//! lock, but a delayed Node stale contender can unlink a newer Rust or Node
//! claim. [`registry::lock`] describes the mixed-registry boundary.
