//! Node-compatible file locks: a no-replace claim, decimal holder pid,
//! one stale steal, and release by unlink. Rust builds the 0600 owner inode
//! under a sibling temporary name and hard-links it into place so the lock
//! pathname is never visible before its pid content.
//!
//! Two locks per session: `<name>.lock` (creation/metadata) and
//! `<name>.events.lock` (event log). Whenever both are taken the order is
//! event lock first, then creation lock (`with_both_locks`).
//!
//! node: src/sessions.ts:2273-2336, 2374-2386; src/events.ts:224-249
//!
//! # Rust and Node lock contenders
//!
//! Rust publishes a complete 0600 owner inode with one no-replace hard link,
//! so its lock pathname is never visible empty. When stealing a stale lock it
//! takes an advisory lock on the inode it inspected and verifies that the
//! pathname still names that inode before unlinking. A delayed Rust stealer
//! therefore cannot remove a newer owner's lock.
//!
//! Node still creates the canonical file before writing its pid and steals
//! with an unbound read-then-unlink sequence. Rust safely respects a live Node
//! lock once its complete pid is visible, and Rust-only stale recovery is
//! exclusive. If a concurrent stale-recovery path involves Node, however, a
//! delayed Node contender can unlink a newer Rust or Node claim.
