# Registry writes — Specification

This document specifies when the Rust daemon rewrites `<id>.json`, the output-activity sidecar, and the client generation. It builds on [requirements.md](./requirements.md).

## Status

Active. Implemented in the Rust daemon and pty-core. The rationale, the consumer audit and the rejected options are in [decision 0015](../../decisions/0015-the-record-changes-only-when-a-fact-does.md).

## Scope

Defined here: which daemon events write `<id>.json`, the sidecar's path, schema, write and removal, the reader precedence for `lastOutputAtMs`, and the `clientGeneration` counter.

Not defined here: the record's other fields and key order ([docs/parity.md](../../parity.md) section 5), the metadata lock and the generation-fenced mutation (`crates/pty-core/src/registry/mutate.rs`), the events log `<id>.events.jsonl`, and the Node daemon's writes.

## Writers of `<id>.json`

| Event | Written fields | Guard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publication at daemon start | the whole record, Node publication order | creation lock |
| Tag, name, metadata patch (CLI) | the changed fields | metadata lock, CAS as requested |
| Writable client attaches | `lastAttachAt`, `clientGeneration` | metadata lock, `expectedGeneration` |
| Client facts change (below) | `clientGeneration` | metadata lock, `expectedGeneration` |
| Child exits | `exitCode`, `exitedAt`, `lastLines`, `lastOutputAtMs` | metadata lock, `expectedGeneration` |
| Child output | nothing (sidecar only) | – |

Every other daemon event leaves the record alone (`PTY.REGW-R01`).

## Output-activity sidecar

Path: `<root>/.activity/<id>.json`. The directory is created on first use with mode `0700`.

```json
{"generation":"4e244e77d9f468d07151fb9bd894abb5","lastOutputAtMs":1790441064309}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generation` | string | the daemon generation that saw the output |
| `lastOutputAtMs` | integer | unix milliseconds of that generation's newest output |

Write sequence (`PTY.REGW-R02`):

1. Each output chunk sets the in-memory stamp to now. If no persist is pending, one is scheduled 1 s out.
2. When it falls due and the child has not exited, the daemon publishes the sidecar by temp file and rename inside `.activity/`. Failure is ignored.
3. At exit the stamp goes into the exit record. When that write lands (`Changed` or `Unchanged`), the daemon removes the sidecar (`PTY.REGW-R04`). Shutdown's later retry does not rewrite a record whose exit facts have not changed. A `GenerationMismatch` leaves the sidecar, because it may be a replacement's.

Removal with the session: `cleanup_all_while_locked` (and so `cleanup_all`, `cleanup_owned_all`, `cleanup`), `remove_session_generation`, and gc's raw-candidate cleanup unlink the sidecar with the other session files (`PTY.REGW-R04`).

### Reader precedence

`pty_core::registry::last_output_at_ms(name, &metadata)` uses the ambient root;
`last_output_at_ms_in(root, name, &metadata)` uses an explicit root, as with
`list_sessions_in`. Both apply the pure `newest_output_at_ms(&metadata, sidecar)`
(`PTY.REGW-R03`):

```
record has exitedAt                          → record.lastOutputAtMs
sidecar.generation == record.generation      → sidecar.lastOutputAtMs
otherwise                                    → record.lastOutputAtMs   (Node daemons, older Rust daemons)
```

## Client generation

`clientGeneration` is an unsigned integer in `<id>.json`. It is absent until the first change, starts from 1 in each daemon generation, and increases by one per change (`PTY.REGW-R05`).

Client facts: the negotiated `(rows, cols)` and, for every client that constrains the size (writable, has attached), `(connection id, rows, cols)` in connection order.

| Event | Bumps |
| --- | --- |
| ATTACH | always; the same write stamps `lastAttachAt` |
| RESIZE from a writable client | when the facts differ from the last bumped facts |
| A writable client leaves (DETACH or socket close) | when the facts differ |
| A writable client sends PEEK (becomes readonly) | when the facts differ |
| PEEK, STATUS or send from any other connection, and its close | never; the facts are not computed (`PTY.REGW-R06`) |

Write: one `mutate_metadata_under_lock` with `expectedGeneration` = the daemon's generation, setting `clientGeneration` to the in-memory counter and a pending `lastAttachAt`. On `Busy` or `Stale` the write is retried every 10 ms until 2 s after the first attempt, then dropped (`PTY.REGW-T02`). A later change resets the retry window and writes the newer counter. `Missing` and `GenerationMismatch` end the attempt.

## Edge cases

- **Replacement under the same id.** The old daemon's sidecar names the old generation and is ignored by readers. The old daemon's client writes fail their generation fence.
- **Exited session with attached clients.** A client leaving after exit still bumps the counter; the exit record is not otherwise touched.
- **Node daemon.** Writes `lastOutputAtMs` and `recovery.metadataRevision` into the record and never writes `clientGeneration`; `PTY.REGW-A03` excludes it from these requirements.
