# Usage: scripts/conformance-both.sh [--node <bin>] [--rust <bin>] [--out <dir>] [test-file ...]
#   --node   the reference binary (default: `pty` on PATH)
#   --rust   the binary under port (default: target/debug/pty after `cargo build -p pty`)
#   --out    where per-file logs and `red.txt` go (default: target/conformance)
#   test-file  names like `integration_sync` (default: every tests/*.rs)
#
# Each side's raw log lives in <out>/<label>/<file>.log; <out>/red.txt lists the
# tests that pass on the first binary and fail on the second, with the first
# line of each failure message.

# One `cargo test` per file, on purpose.
#
# The obvious optimisation is to pass every `--test` to a single invocation.
# It saves almost nothing and it can silently break the comparison.
#
# It saves almost nothing: measured 2026-09-05, five files cost 10.48 s as five
# invocations and 10.27 s as one, and the tests inside account for 10.21 s of
# that. Cargo overhead is about 0.05 s per file. The suite is slow because it
# drives real processes through real PTYs and waits for them, not because of
# how it is invoked.
#
# It can break the comparison: `cargo test` STOPS at the first failing target.
# A single invocation that hits a failure never runs the remaining files, and
# the failing files are exactly the ones this script exists to look at — a run
# that stopped early reports fewer differences, which reads as agreement. Any
# collapse of this loop needs `--no-fail-fast`, and even then it costs the
# per-file logs the summary table is built from.
