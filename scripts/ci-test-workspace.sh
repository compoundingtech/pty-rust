# Run the workspace suite, and re-run a failing test binary once before
# calling it a defect.
#
# This is not leniency, it is the procedure the README already documents:
# "One test failing in a whole-workspace run is not yet a defect. Re-run it
# alone before treating it as one." The suite drives real processes through
# real PTYs, 139 binaries run in parallel, and on a loaded machine one of them
# can lose a race. A GitHub runner is a loaded machine.
#
# The re-run is single-threaded and covers only the binaries that failed, so a
# real failure still fails: it has to lose twice, once under contention and
# once alone.
